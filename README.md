# employee-password-generator

## Description
This project serves as my first attempt at building an application using JavaScript. Functionally, it is a 'password generator'--it produces random strings of characters based on given criteria. It is interactive, requiring the user to click a button before launching, and adaptable, altering its content according to user selections.
